# CropDoctor-App
CropDoctor is a smart crop health diagnosis app that detects plant diseases from leaf images using AI, helping farmers make faster and better farming decisions.


# CropDoctor App
**AI-powered crop disease diagnosis for smarter farming**
CropDoctor is a machine learning–based application that detects and classifies crop diseases using leaf images.  
The app helps farmers, agronomists, and agri-tech platforms identify plant diseases at an early stage and take timely preventive actions to reduce crop loss.

## Problem Statement
Crop diseases are one of the major reasons for reduced agricultural productivity.  
Traditional disease identification requires expert knowledge, which is often inaccessible to small-scale farmers.  
Late detection leads to increased crop damage, excessive pesticide usage, and financial loss.

## Solution Overview
CropDoctor uses **deep learning and computer vision** to analyze leaf images and accurately predict crop diseases.  
Users can upload or capture a leaf image, and the system provides:
- Disease classification
- Faster diagnosis
- Decision support for early intervention

The solution is scalable and can be integrated into mobile apps, web platforms, or agricultural advisory systems.
